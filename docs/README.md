# Adafruit Mynewt Documentation

**WARNING**: This documentation was written across several releases of Mynewt,
starting with `0.9.0`, and may contain some content that is no longer valid in
the latest release. This guide should serve as an excellent starting point,
but be sure to consult the official Mynewt documentation if you run into any
issues.

These guides are not exhaustive, and were written simply for internal use
during the initial Mynewt project development phase in the hopes that other
users may benefit from the investment we put into learning this Mynewt tools
and platform.
